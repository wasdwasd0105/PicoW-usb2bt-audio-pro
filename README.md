# PicoW USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter
The Pico W USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter transforms your Raspberry Pi Pico W into a high-quality, hassle-free audio streaming device.
It allows any device with a USB input, including MacOS, Windows, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5, and more, to gain Bluetooth Audio capability.
With Pico W Adapter, you can easily transmit audio wirelessly from your USB audio source to your Bluetooth headphones or speaker, enhancing your listening experience.

### Driver-Free Setup
Setting up PicoW requires no driver or software installation. Simply plug the Pico W into your device's USB port, set your Bluetooth headphones or speakers to pairing mode, and an automatic connection will be made.

### Bluetooth SBC Codec
Pico W Bluetooth Adapter utilizes the sbc codec to deliver high-quality audio. It can steam with stereo sound.

## Installation

Installing the Pico W USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter firmware involves flashing a UF2 (USB Flashing Format) file onto your Raspberry Pi Pico. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the UF2 file:** You can find the latest firmware for the PicoW USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter at the [releases page](https://github.com/wasdwasd0105/PicoW-usb2bt-audio/releases) of the GitHub repository. Download the `.uf2` file from the latest release.

2. **Connect the Pico to your computer:** First, ensure that your Pico is not connected to your computer. Then, hold down the 'BOOTSEL' button on the Pico while you plug it into your computer using a micro USB cable. It will appear on your computer as a mass storage device (like a USB flash drive).

3. **Copy the UF2 file:** Simply drag and drop (or copy and paste) the downloaded UF2 file onto the Pico.

4. **Reset the Pico:** Once the UF2 file has been copied onto the Pico, it will automatically reset and start running the new firmware.



## Usage

Using the PicoW USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter is a straightforward process. Here are the steps to follow:

1. **Connect your Pico W to your audio source device:** Use a USB cable to connect your Raspberry Pi Pico W to the device that you want to stream audio from.

2. **Set the audio output on your source device:** On your audio source device, go to your sound settings and change the audio output device to `USB Bluetooth Audio`.

3. **Pairing a new device:** To pair a new device, long press the 'BOOTSEL' button on the Pico W and release it the led light will blink fast. Then, put the new Bluetooth device into pairing mode. The Pico W will automatically connect to it.

4. **Start playing audio:** Once everything is set up, you can start playing audio from your source device. The audio will be streamed to your Bluetooth device via the Pico W.

5. **Reconnecting a device:** You can reconnect the headphone by short pressing the 'BOOTSEL' button.



## Green LED light Status Indicator

1. **Blinking Slow (1s):** When the Green LED light is blinking, it indicates that audio is currently streaming.
2. **Blinking Fast (0.5s):** It means that the PicoW Adapter is in pairing mode.
3. **On (Steady Light):** It means that the PicoW Adapter is on standby. Short-press the key to reconnect the last saved device.


## Compile & Debug

In order to compile the PicoW USB Audio to Bluetooth Adapter firmware from source code, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your environment:** Make sure that you have a working development environment for Raspberry Pi Pico projects. This includes having the required compiler and tools installed. You may refer to the [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/rp2040/getting-started/) guide for detailed instructions.

2. **Set environment variables:** Before you can build the project, you need to set two environment variables: `PICO_SDK_PATH` and `PICO_EXTRAS_PATH`. For example:

```bash
export PICO_SDK_PATH=~/pico-sdk
export PICO_EXTRAS_PATH=~/pico-extras
```

3. **Build the project:** After setting up your environment, navigate to the project directory in a terminal and run the provided build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This script should compile the project and produce a UF2 firmware file that you can flash onto your Pico W.

4. **Debug Serial input/output:** You can use uart to see the debug info. Connect the GPIO 0 and 1 as TX and RX. To enable BTstack's serial input, you can uncomment `HAVE_BTSTACK_STDIN` under btstack_config.h
